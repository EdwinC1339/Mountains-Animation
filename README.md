# Mountains-Animation

This is a small project I made to get some practice using openframeworks' sound features. When the user loads a song it will play the song and the animation will work like a visualizer. Note that I'm actually adding some noise to the data to make it look like a mountain range, though, most of the bands stay at 0 normally so it would just look very spiky in the left and the rest of the points would stay on the same level.
